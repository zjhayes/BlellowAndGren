# Blellow & Gren
This Unity VR project gives its players the opportunity to see impossible colors. Each eye sees an object as a different color, the brain puts them together to see colors which they can't see when working together.

Requires Unity 2021.3.4f1 and Oculus Quest 2, not tested on other VR systems.

With Oculus linked to computer, run scene and view in Oculus.

Mixed color shader created using: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SinglePassInstancing.html
Science based on Action Labs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQCsDfEqr9o

Results not guarenteed, but it's better than crossing your eyes.
